## How to Play

The objective of the game is to guide the player character from the grass to the water at the top of the screen without colliding into enemy bugs. The player starts at the grass bottom of the screen, which contains a road with bugs in the middle, speeding along it horizontally. The player must guide the character between opposing lanes of bug traffic to avoid collision, which results in restarting the game. By moving on the player can guide their character to the water.

The player can move left, right, up and down using the arrow keyboard keys.
